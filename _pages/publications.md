**Sadhana**
My Sadhana is my sincere efforts with the aim of self evolution. Once may ask this question: Do we need to evolve? Evolve to what?
Everyone has a different meaning of evolution. For me, evolution must lead to "blissful state of being .. beyond waves and patterns of mind .. which is mostly external in nature".

2. Chanting
